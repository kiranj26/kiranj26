<h2 align="center"> ğŸ˜„ Fun Fact </h2>

In 1993, when Linus Torvalds (Creater of Linux OS)  was teaching at the University of Helsinki, he gave the task of composing email as homework to the students. Yeah, composing emails were a big deal back then. 

A female student named Tove Monni completed the task by sending him an email asking him out on a date. He accepted and three years later the first of their three daughters was born. 

Shall I say he started the internet dating trend? Hmm â€¦ nah! Letâ€™s leave it there ğŸ˜‰
